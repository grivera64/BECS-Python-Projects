# BECS-Python-Projects

This is a compilation of all of the projects I worked on as a TA in the BECS curriculum.

## What is BECS?

Bridge Experience for Computer Science (BECS) is a program directed to help Freshmen persuing a degree in Computer Science
get a head start at learning the basics through an easy-to-understand, tailored Python course.

## How do I run the source code?

0. Install the latest version of Python

---

### Ubuntu/Linux:

```sh
sudo apt-get install python3.9
```
### Windows:

```txt
Download the latest version from the official python website
``` 
Link here -> [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org/)

---

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://www.github.com/givera64/BECS-Python-Projects.git
```

2. `cd` into the BECS-Python-Projects folder
```sh
cd BECS-Python-Projects
```

3. Run the project using `python`

Linux/MacOS

```sh
python3.9 project1/todolist.py

NOTE: You will need to get an API key and store it into a file named `token.txt` to run project2.

You can get one here: [https://aqicn.org/data-platform/token/#/](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/token/#/)
